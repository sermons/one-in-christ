11 Therefore, remember that formerly you who are Gentiles by birth and called “uncircumcised” by those who call themselves “the circumcision” (which is done in the body by human hands)—
所 以 你 們 應 當 記 念 ： 你 們 從 前 按 肉 體 是 外 邦 人 ， 是 稱 為 沒 受 割 禮 的 ； 這 名 原 是 那 些 憑 人 手 在 肉 身 上 稱 為 受 割 禮 之 人 所 起 的 。

12 remember that at that time you were separate from Christ, excluded from citizenship in Israel and foreigners to the covenants of the promise, without hope and without God in the world.
那 時 ， 你 們 與 基 督 無 關 ， 在 以 色 列 國 民 以 外 ， 在 所 應 許 的 諸 約 上 是 局 外 人 ， 並 且 活 在 世 上 沒 有 指 望 ， 沒 有 神 。

13 But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far away have been brought near by the blood of Christ.
你 們 從 前 遠 離 神 的 人 ， 如 今 卻 在 基 督 耶 穌 裡 ， 靠 著 他 的 血 ， 已 經 得 親 近 了 。

14 For he himself is our peace, who has made the two groups one and has destroyed the barrier, the dividing wall of hostility,
因 他 使 我 們 和 睦 （ 原 文 作 ： 因 他 是 我 們 的 和 睦 ） ， 將 兩 下 合 而 為 一 ， 拆 毀 了 中 間 隔 斷 的 牆 ；

15 by setting aside in his flesh the law with its commands and regulations. His purpose was to create in himself one new humanity out of the two, thus making peace,
而 且 以 自 己 的 身 體 廢 掉 冤 仇 ， 就 是 那 記 在 律 法 上 的 規 條 ， 為 要 將 兩 下 藉 著 自 己 造 成 一 個 新 人 ， 如 此 便 成 就 了 和 睦 。

16 and in one body to reconcile both of them to God through the cross, by which he put to death their hostility.
既 在 十 字 架 上 滅 了 冤 仇 ， 便 藉 這 十 字 架 使 兩 下 歸 為 一 體 ， 與 神 和 好 了 ，

17 He came and preached peace to you who were far away and peace to those who were near.
並 且 來 傳 和 平 的 福 音 給 你 們 遠 處 的 人 ， 也 給 那 近 處 的 人 。

18 For through him we both have access to the Father by one Spirit.
因 為 我 們 兩 下 藉 著 他 被 一 個 聖 靈 所 感 ， 得 以 進 到 父 面 前 。

19 Consequently, you are no longer foreigners and strangers, but fellow citizens with God’s people and also members of his household,
這 樣 ， 你 們 不 再 作 外 人 和 客 旅 ， 是 與 聖 徒 同 國 ， 是 神 家 裡 的 人 了 ；

20 built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, with Christ Jesus himself as the chief cornerstone.
並 且 被 建 造 在 使 徒 和 先 知 的 根 基 上 ， 有 基 督 耶 穌 自 己 為 房 角 石 ，

21 In him the whole building is joined together and rises to become a holy temple in the Lord.
各 （ 或 作 ： 全 ） 房 靠 他 聯 絡 得 合 式 ， 漸 漸 成 為 主 的 聖 殿 。

22 And in him you too are being built together to become a dwelling in which God lives by his Spirit.
你 們 也 靠 他 同 被 建 造 ， 成 為 神 藉 著 聖 靈 居 住 的 所 在 。

> #### Isa 57:15-19
For this is what the high and exalted One says
he who lives forever, whose name is holy:
“I live in a high and holy place,
but also with the one who is contrite and lowly in spirit,
to revive the spirit of the lowly
and to revive the heart of the contrite.
I will not accuse them forever,
nor will I always be angry,
for then they would faint away because of me
the very people I have created.
I was enraged by their sinful greed;
I punished them, and hid my face in anger,
yet they kept on in their willful ways.
I have seen their ways, but I will heal them;
I will guide them and restore comfort to Israel’s mourners,
creating praise on their lips.
Peace, peace, to those far and near,”
says the Lord. “And I will heal them.”

> #### 1Pe 2:4-6
The Living Stone and a Chosen People
As you come to him, the living Stone—rejected by humans but chosen by God and precious to him— you also, like living stones, are being built into a spiritual house to be a holy priesthood, offering spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ. For in Scripture it says:
>
“See, I lay a stone in Zion,
a chosen and precious cornerstone,
and the one who trusts in him
will never be put to shame.”
